# UI Components

This directory is reserved for the shadcn/ui primitives that power the application's design system. Treat everything here as foundational building blocks that can be composed elsewhere.

## Policy
- **Do not add feature-specific or business logic components here.**
- Only include components generated by `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component>` and minimal mutations required to support theming, accessibility, or design tokens.
- Document any custom variants or breaking changes to upstream shadcn defaults in this README.

## What belongs here
- Base primitives such as `button.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `toast.tsx`, etc.
- Thin wrappers that extend shadcn components with shared props, Tailwind variants, or small accessibility tweaks.
- Theme configuration that affects all consumers (for example, updating `buttonVariants`).

## What does not belong here
- Feature UIs (boards, admin tables, forms, dashboards).
- Layout constructs (navigation, headers, footers).
- Components with business logic, data fetching, or dependency injection.
- Composite widgets that combine multiple primitives into a product-specific piece.

Place reusable composites in `presentation/components/shared` and feature-specific components under `presentation/components/features/<feature>`.

## Installation
Add new primitives using the official generator:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion
npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert-dialog
```

Review generated files before committing to ensure they align with our naming and styling conventions.

## Customisation checklist
1. Keep the exported component API compatible with shadcn defaults.
2. Extend variants using `class-variance-authority` where needed.
3. Maintain TypeScript support, forwarding refs and props correctly.
4. Update this README when adding new primitives or notable variants.

## Current primitives
`avatar`, `badge`, `breadcrumb`, `button`, `card`, `carousel`, `collapsible`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `input`, `separator`, `sheet`, `sidebar`, `skeleton`, `switch`, `tabs`, `textarea`, `toast`, `toaster`, `tooltip`.
